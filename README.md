### Basic Info

I'm an undergraduate at Nanjing University, major in Computer Science and Technology.

Like many students in this major, I enjoy writing codes, and pursue cool code styles and coding tools.

I like things that have beautiful forms. Thus, I'm interested in mathematics and functional programming languages and the math model behind them.

I'm interested in practical technologies as well.
